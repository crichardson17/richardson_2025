The MBH-Z relation uses the following keys,

MBH-Z = 0: fiducial black hole mass of 10^5 M_sun, independent of metallicity
MBH-Z = 1: light seeds
MBH-Z = 2: moderate seeds
MBH-Z = 3: heavy seeds

The metallicity is given in the log relative to solar, 12+ log(O/H) = 8.76; however, to get the gas-phase abundance, one needs to subtract -0.11 dex to account for grain depletion. See Richardson+ 2025 for more details.
